title : "Agile Retrospectives: Useful Tool or Empty Ceremony?"
---

I went along to another ThoughtWorks Geek Night yesterday, this one covering Agile Retrospectives by [Akash Bhalla][1].

While the talk covered four main sections (Prime directive, safety check, action items and facilitator), I thought it was worth summarising the main points I took away from the evening:

###Prime directive

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

I haven't come across the prime directive before, so I'll be doing some further reading. The point was made though to "pretend" that the above statement is true for a retrospective and put differences aside for an hour to make the most of the session. Also, link to [Questioning the Retrospective Prime Directive][2] was given.

###Safety check

Again, this one was new to me. A check should be done by the facilitator on how "safe" the members feel. A safety score of 1-5 (or another system) should be submitted anonymously by attendees. A low score indicates a member is not comfortable discussing certain topics, or perhaps the location of the retrospective is too public (like in an open office). A high score indicates the member is comfortable discussing any topic.

If the overall score is too low changes should be implemented based on (anonymous) team feedback. The safety check should then be redone, or the retrospective stopped if necessary.

###External stakeholders

It was advised that external stakeholders should not be part of a retrospective. The aim is to learn from day-to-day operations which involves the team only, it also affects the safety within a retrospective. A separate session could be held with external parties however and then feedback given to the team.

###Actions items

* Always recap on actions from the last retrospective
* Actions should never be handed out, only volunteered for
* If nobody volunteers for an action then it should not be recorded as an action item - if it was important enough someone would have stepped forward
* Keep actions [SMART][3]
* If actions don't get completed assign an Action Cop - someone who will chase action items. They need to be measurable and timely to allow for this (see SMART above)

###Always be prepared

The facilitator should always prepare for the retrospective. If 10 people are attending that's 10 hours of time being given up for the session - the least you can do is spend half an hour preparing.

###Leave me alone

The facilitator or other team members should not force another member to get involved, perhaps by asking for someones opinion when they have not said anything during the retrospective. Team members should consider the "safety" of the group (based on the safety check) and be aware that some members may not be comfortable discussing all topics, or may just want to listen.

Another enjoyable and well presented talk from ThoughtWorks Manchester.
